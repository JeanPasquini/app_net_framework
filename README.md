# Connection_NET üìå

Connection_NET is a project designed to showcase my skills in mastering the .NET Framework, using it in a semi-real project environment to handle scenarios involving dynamic permission management. This approach simplifies project security and management while also enabling seamless integration of new features and collaboration with team members.

# Implementation üö©

Currently, the application operates using only local databases, and the required queries to set up all necessary data are included within the application itself. Please follow these steps to get started:

## Requirements

- Database: SQL Server
- SQL Express - localhost
- .NET 4.8.2 or higher (If you are using Windows 8 or above, you can ignore this requirement)

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Open the application and click on the configuration menu near the login button.
2. In the newly opened tab, click the button responsible for downloading the database and wait for your SQL Server to load.
3. Log in manually to your local database to properly execute the query.
4. The SQL Server will display the query with all the data needed to use the application; execute the query and wait for it to complete.
5. The query includes two predefined users for the application: admin and user, both with the password '1234'.
6. Enjoy exploring the application.
